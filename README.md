 ## Research Assistant Program at Next Solution Lab (NSL)

I worked as a Research Assistant at Next Solution Lab (NSL), where I focused on learning algorithms, data structures, and basic Python. Additionally, I gained experience in deep learning techniques. This repository contains projects and code developed during my time at the lab.
